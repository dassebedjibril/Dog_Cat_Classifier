# Dog_Cat_Classifier
The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a 
dog or cat. The dataset is comprised of photos of dogs and cats provided as a subset of photos from a much larger dataset


In this `project`, we build an algorithm, a deep learning model to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat. 
This is easy for humans, dogs, and cats. Computers find it a bit more difficult.

### Requirements

We recommend to create a virtual environment using conda or virtualenv, and then setup environment using
`pip install -r requirements.txt` for setting up the environment. We have used `Python 3.6.7` for development. 
Below is the detailed.
